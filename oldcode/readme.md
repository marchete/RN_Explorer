This was the original code I used to solve levels 800 to 1000. There were many iterations before this final version. "NS_Strings_v16d_6.cpp" is the 16th version and "d" revision of Number Shift "Strings" branch. Yes, I had a loooot of different iterations of the code.

The cleaned code "RN_ExploDiv_7.cpp" should perform similarly to this code, and it has some additional bugfixes. On tests with level 1000 and level 200 to 600 it performed well.

The code is messy because it's not aimed for production level. It's just to solve a problem, I priorized results over code, as code is disposable once the goal is achieved.

This is not representative of any good practices or production-level code.

Some little parts of the code are removed, they are marked as TODO's to avoid naive Copy&Paste
