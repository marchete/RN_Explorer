This was the original code I used to solve levels 800 to 1000. There were many iterations before version. NS_Strings_v16d_6 is the 16th version revision d of Number Shift "Strings" branch.
The code is messy because it's not aimed for production level. It's just to solve a problem, I priorized results over code, as code is disposable once the goal is achieved.
This is not representative of any good practices or production-level code.

Some little parts of the code are removed, they are marked as TODO's to avoid naive Copy&Paste
